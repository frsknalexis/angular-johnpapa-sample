### Dev Builds
The dev build does not optimize the deployed code. It simply runs it in place. You can run a dev build in multiple ways.

####Option 1 - Serve
Type `gulp serve-dev` and browse to `http://localhost:7200`

####Option 2 - Serve and Debug Node
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug` and browse to `http://localhost:7200` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

####Option 3 - Serve and Debug Node Breaking on 1st Line
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug-brk` and browse to `http://localhost:7200` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

### Staging Build
The staging build is an optimized build. Type `gulp serve-stage` and browse to `http://localhost:7200`

## Testing
Type `gulp test` to run the tests including both unit and midway tests (spins up a server). This will create a watch on the files, with a 5 second delay, to run the tests.

Testing uses karma, mocha, chai, sinon, ngMidwayTester libraries.
